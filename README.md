# Remindful

A spaced repetition app for everything you want to remember.

Capture notes, links, images, and PDFs. Review them on a schedule that adapts to how well you know each item.

## Features

- **Capture anything** — text, URLs, images, PDFs
- **Smart scheduling** — spaced repetition surfaces items right before you'd forget
- **Daily limits** — control your review load
- **Catalog view** — browse and filter all your items
- **Offline-first** — works without internet, syncs when connected
- **Your data** — export/import for backup and portability

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Opens at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Install as a PWA for the best experience.
